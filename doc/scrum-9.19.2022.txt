GOAL: dev run 30 w/ 1st order mle estimates
along the string of constant amax
for L=5 and L=10
for amax=1.78,10.147 from the FK,LR models with diffCoeff=0.0005,0.001,respectively

#TODO: get 1st order MLE fits to the most recent data runs.
#HINT: adapt the existing pipeline to this new setting
#for each of the full models:
# for each 0th order mle estimate:
#    select a,D,neighbor,L to get scatter plot of r,kappa
#    estimate linear interpolating function of r,kappa
#    compute the r,kappa of the maximum likelihood estimate / least squares estimate
#    record

#TODO: use ^that record to generate run 30

# Q: Does L=5 --> L=10 lead to kappa*pi*r**2 becoming approximately doubled (2X)?
# A: For LR, yes. For FK, no, though it might at larger domain sizes.
