TODO(Fig. 1):
- label tips in colors based on clockwise/counter clockwise
- remake with 1 panel before 1 panel after annihilation
- switch to FK model
- increase apparent resolution
- remove 1 cm scale bar. Just state this in the caption
- remove "Pow!" Before publishing. It is good for my candidacy exam.


TOOD(Fig. 2-->3? Or 2?): 
- (null --> A) show dRdt versus R to show an attractive force is reasonable(keep in Fig. 2, this is motivation for the attractive force).
- switch panels (A,B,C) --> (B,C,A). 
	- (B) a=0 doesn't work. (C) With an attractive force we can sweep through the slopes, and (A) it provides a good fit.


TODO(Fig. 3-->2? Or 3?):


---------------
TODO: 
Potential model for creation
- pick a random point at least a certain distance from any other spiral tip
- can we do this using time reversal of the annihilation rate method.

Fig 4. Explanation for attractive force

Include figure panel motivating the diffusive force.



TODO: adjust manuscript to PRL format
TODO: try to have a copy worth iterating on by this weekend

TODO: give powerpoint tomorrow by 
NOTE: there is an enormous risk of me going over time
TODO: practice and time self before practice talk tomorrow at 1pm
