TODO: put together an MVP of figure 2 (log-log plot of annihilation rates + fits)
(i) Does our particle model reproduce our previous annihilation rates?

TODO: put together an MVP of figure 1 (exemplar annihilation event from Luo-Rudy model)
(i) What is spiral tip pair annihilation?

TODO: put together an MVP of figure 3 (a 6 panel figure...)
(i) How did we fit the particle model to the annihilation rates?

TODO: copy and paste Figure 1-3 for the Spiral Tip Particle Model manuscript manuscript_SPM

TODO(for ideas on what to do): refer to 'meeting with WJ and PM 12.8.2021.txt' and 'meeting with WJ and PM 12.1.2021.txt' and  consider relevance to

TODO(.odg): make 1 text box for each of the following as Fig. 4A-C
Fig. 4.A(MSR plots of the LR model to the 1/R particle model and the oscillatory model (inset) box-and-whisker plots of particle lifetimes from the full model)
(i) How do these 1/R forces can be estimated using the oscillatory model?
(ii) How we relate these 1/R forces to the oscillatory model, knowing what we know about the particle lifetimes?

Fig. 4.B(??)
(iii) How do these measurements effect the expected duration of spiral defect chaos?

Fig. 4.C(??)
(iv) How do we control the apparent magnitude of these forces in the full models?

TODO(.odg/bgmc): dev Fig. 4A-C
