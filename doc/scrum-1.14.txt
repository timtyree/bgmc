TODO: show whether this oscillatory force function can explain the LR model.

TODO: if so, we should should whether the oscillatory force can explain the FK model

Failing ^that:
-  Consider phases that agree powerlaw fast
-  Consider phases that agree but only up to some constant phase, such as Ï€/2.
