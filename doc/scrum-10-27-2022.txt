TODO: update x-axes of Figure S2 from n to N
TODO(later): add this to the .odg file with the universal (a-a0)/a1 vs. omega*Gamma trace
%src: main text of Letter before being sent to SI.
% \textbf{e} Plot of Equation~\ref{eqn:mslim} resulting from consistent mean-squared distance between annihilating particles from the linear and oscillatory particle models.
The inset angles correspond to $\phi_f$.
Shaded regions indicate 95\% confidence intervals of the mean value, determined via bootstrap.
% with angles increasing in the clockwise direction.
% Indicated are apparent mean lifetimes, $\Gamma$, rescaled by angular frequency, $\omega$, for the (blue) FK and (orange) LR models.
