DONE: run with Nmax=50, and no attraction/repulsion
DONE: get a simulation that returns a reasonably slow Tavg (HINT: try N=6)
DONE: get observable effect of forces to appear Tavg for one N
DONE: make a quick test suite that shows/verifies the general effect of (i) only attractive forces, (ii) only repulsive forces with comparison to (iii) no forces!

DONE: use ^that to determine the qualitative effect of x_0>0 for attractive/repulsive only forces AND for positive/negative potential energy barrier.

DONE: test runtimes at (i) weak forces and (ii) at strong forces

DONE: integrate method with current pipeline

DONE: show effect of forces on exponent
