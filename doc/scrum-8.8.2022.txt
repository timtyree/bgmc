- Option 1: make run 24 with L=10
  - Pros:
    - backcompatable
  - Cons:
    - may necessitate scaling between domain sizes
- Option 2: make run 24 with L=5
  - Pros:
    - no rescaling necessary, as the same domain is used 200x200
    - i don't try to merge loose grid searches (which is a waste of time)
    - higher quality product
  - Cons:
    - i'll need to do a couple back of envelope estimates re:
    - DONE!
      - DONT: fiddle with the number of iterations per job...


TODO: dev run 24
controlled by return_CollTimes.sh

==> use L=5 for the one in the manuscript.



TODO: Q: Can I write a quick .sh script that tests the scale invariances of powerlaws?
- subtract the results of two data runs, Alice and Bob
    - Alice:  parameter setting with L=5
    - Bob: parameter setting with L=10 scaled to match ibid
