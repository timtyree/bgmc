DONE(later, on iPad): simplest model for unitary connections between phases explaining some parameter for varkappa conditioned on a characteristic interaction lengthscale/preferred length, x0.
DONE: implement only attractive boolean nullifiers
DONE: plot local results for
- (i) varkappa<0 and x0=0
- (ii) varkappa>0 and x0=0
- (iii) varkappa>0 and x0>0
- (iii) varkappa<0 and x0>0
- (iv, maybe?) only attracting and/or only repulsing
