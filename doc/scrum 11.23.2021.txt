token observed values
input:
LR:
  - a_hat: 8.595 +/- 0.3771 (short timescale)
  - D: 0.586055	+/- 0.087553 (long timescale)
FK:
  - a_hat: 7.3923	+/- 0.6018 (short timescale)
  - D: 0.365238	0.004171 (long timescale)

output:
- MSR versus tdeath from 2 particle sim
- annihilation rate from interpolating function

GOAL: compare the resulting MSR to the MSR observed for the full model.
DONE: plug the apparent a,D values from the full models into the 2-particle model
DONE: plot MSR versus tdeath that results from ^that 2-particle simulation
DONE: find (or plot overlay) MSR versus tdeath that results from full models
DONE: quantify how bad the disagreement is when we put in ahat: Put the effect on the annihilation rates into a table where we put in a=ahat

DONE: make minimalist ipynb to interpolate and plot annihilation rates using 'generation of table of powerfits.ipynb'
DONE: make annihilation rate figs from token apparent obs using powerlaw fit
DONE: make annihilation rate figs from token apparent obs using powerlaw fit


DONE: fill in table of particle properties with uncertainties
DONE: copy M,nu,a_emergent values into table from Slides
DONE: copy D_apparent values into table from Slides
DONE: find reasonable estimates for the apparent a,D values. add to table

DONE: use D_apparent to estimate a_sr_corrected
HINT: for trend, see Control-attraction-coefficient-with-diffusion.pdf
HINT: using the time averaging method: at short lags, D_FK=1.4 cm^2/s.  at long lags, D_FK=0.6
HINT: using the ensemble averaging method: D_FK=0.36

DONE: make a slide summarizing what i did today.  share with WJ and PM. consider including a token table?

TODO(test for screening): Compare the density squared to the max distance in the attraction coefficient measurement.  This gives us reason whether or not to suspect screening


TODO: perform sensitivity check by plotting annihilation rates from the particle model that result from apparent values of the attraction coefficient
TODO: determine whether M,nu values that result from the apparent a,D are reasonable by plotting m,M on an x,y scatterplot for (blue) the FK model and (orange) the LR model.

TODO: estimate the conduction velocity of a plane wave for LR,FK with DVmem=0.001,0.0005
TODO: measure a for the FK model with D_Vmem=0.001 & 0.0005. put in excel table

TODO(uncertainty estimation): sensitivity analysis of r and kappa intersection method.   M+- Delta_M, nu+-Delta_nu



TODO: plot apparent a,D from full models with a sliding time window

***11.17.2021***
TODO: copy M,nu,a_emergent values into table
TODO: find reasonable estimates for the apparent a,D values. add to table
TODO: plug the apparent a,D values from the full models into the 2-particle model, and compare the resulting MSR to the MSR observed for the full model.


***11.4.2021***
---
DONE: plot MSR versus tf-t for the full models
TODO: for LR model, measure ahat, D=0.7, and compare to the a=8.5 that emerged from the particle model.  Is ahat observed?
TODO: compute RMSE of the annihilation rates from plugging a_hat into the particle model.  See how bad other values of a give in the return_CollTimes.x

Q:Can we not really conclude that the attractive force is 1/R?
A:Yes. This is supported by all reasonable  bootstrapped observations of dR/dt vs. 1/R
TODO: test ^that with the following:
Repeat simulation with particles further appart.
Stop the particles when they are further appart.
We are looking for the scaling here.
Try using a larger time step.
Repeat for larger distances.


***8.25.2021***
TODO: make a figure for the expected particle properties for the full models.
Fig. X the Fenton-Karma model (blue) and the Luo-Rudy model (orange) on the same plot for (A) the curve yielding a:=varkappa and (B) the curve yielding D.  The t-score for the hypothesis that spiral tip parameters, a and D, are the same for the two models, is ?? and ??, respectively


***10.13.2021***
TODO(test for screening): Compare the density squared to the max distance in the attraction coefficient measurement.  This gives us reason whether or not to suspect screening

***10.27.2021***
TODO: investigate the optimal time averaging windows conditioned on the value of D.
---
TODO: find solution for the Mean First Passage time problem for the mean range versus time until collision R(t).

Does there exist a critical range where increasing D has no effect on the MFPT?
Perhaps beyond this range more D-> smaller MFPT. Perhaps at closer ranges, more D-> bigger MFPT.


__GOAL: get final results for PRL paper__
DONE: design/init an attraction coefficient / particle properties table
particle_properties:

- a_sr: from R^2 versus t from the full model.  may involve smoothing durations, tavg1 and tavg2
- a_emergent_sr: from R^2 versus t with the 2 particle simulation with a_emergent and D_apparent as inputs

annihilation_powerlaw_fits:
- M: overall magnitude
- nu: powerlaw exponent
