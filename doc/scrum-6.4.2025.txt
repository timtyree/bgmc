Q: for Eqn. (4), should we have k \neq i,j or just k\neq i.
A: Bottom Line Up Front: Eqn. (4) is correct.  
A(extended): What I did in my code was to have just k\neq i, and to have a stronger creation force proportional to this variable, chi, which is dimensionless.  You thought it would be better for us to use b instead of chi, so you derived the conversion that I have been using the following python code to do the conversion from b to chi:
# a (cm2/s) 1.552 ± 0.016 9.3 ±0.3
# % \textcolor{red}{$b=a(\chi -1)$}
# % b=10.0 +/- 0.5 cm^2/s (LR)
# % b=10.0399 +/- 0.4766 cm^2/s (LR)
# % 	- chi=2.0796 +/- 0.0542
# % b=3.01 +/- 0.08 cm^2/s (FK)
# % b=3.0122 +/- 0.0773 cm^2/s (FK)
# % 	- chi=2.9408 +/- 0.0508
def map_b_to_chi(b,a):
    x = b/a
    chi = x+1
    return chi

The outward creation force is implemented in python as proportional to $\chi a \Delta t / R_{pair}$.

The effect this has is the attractive force is canceled by a stronger creation force, resulting in outward drift.  Canceling the creation force and working in terms of b is equivalent to Eqn. (4).

DONE: look in my code and figure out which one ^it is.

DONE: check Fig. 4 is up-to-date
DONE: make sure they Nmax=10 (FK) and Nmax=16 (LR)
DONE: change N_initial to N in Fig. 4

DONE: LaTeX up my Appendix A, essentially.
TODO(later, after WJ updates with his local copy...): update doc with my new Appendix A and make it flow as a single section.

DONE: add 2 color bars to Fig. 1


***heretim***
TODO: come up with a distribution of the number of spiral tips over time and show that it is similar to the particle model's distribution of particle numbers

TODO: vary system size and look for the same scaling between particle model and full models

TODO: pick a domain size and show the percent speedup for 10s of the cardiac model compared to 10s the particle model.

TODO(important): verify whether we include or exclude <100 ms creation pairs.

TODO: revisit Fig. 2B and verify whether tips pairs with <100ms are discarded.
TODO: change Fig. 2C to 1/cm on the x-axis
TODO: change Fig. 2B x-axis to a linear scale. and see if it looks any good.

TODO: recall how Creation Range is defined and tell WJ (in Fig. 4). is it indeed the distance between two newly created tips?

TODO: separate Fig. 5B into two plots.
