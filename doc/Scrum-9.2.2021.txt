#DONE: copy care/notebooks/lib to bgmc/python/lib_care and then import the custom level-set & intersection functions
#DONE: add level sets to the a versus r graphs for (blue) the FK model and (orange) the LR model
#DONE: plot those level sets on a log-log plot.  Do they follow a powerlaw behavior? No.
#DONE: plot those level sets on a lin-log plot.  Do they follow a logarithmic behavior? No.
#DONT: if so, how does the level set value, nu0 (or M0) vary the function a=a(r;nu0)=a0*r**alpha?
#DONT: if so, how does a0 and/or alpha depend on kappa=250 Hz or kappa=500 Hz?
