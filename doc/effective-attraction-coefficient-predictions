Effective attraction coefficients predicted by MSR consistent theories
SMS:
-  LR: ahat=9.60637,7.28148
-  FK: ahat=1.65037
MS:
- LR: ahat=7.13454,4.99485
- FK: ahat=1.8876
Schema:
- model: effective_attraction_coefficient=<value with G1>,<value with G2>

where G1,G2 are the mean lifetimes of spiral tips measured with or without trivial trajectories considered, respectively.
Including the trivial trajectories improved the goodness of fit to the annihilation rates.
