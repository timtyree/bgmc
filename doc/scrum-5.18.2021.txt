TODO(DONE?): dev two-step spiral tip detection method
(i) 2ms lag to determine presence of spiral tips
(ii) instantaneous method to determine location of spiral tips
TODO: show whether new spiral tips move apart at birth at fine timescale dt=0.001 ms


TODO: use piecewise constant interpolation of the data to compute the apparent reaction rate
TODO: use piecewise constant interpolation of the data to compute the apparent force



TODO: write out (then dev function) that scales domain size to the unit square
TODO: verify results unchanged when scaling down to L=1.
D_new = D/L**2 = 0.02 Hz
L_new = L/L  # = 1
r_new = r/L = .1cm/10cm  = 0.01-0.1
x0_new= x0/L = 1cm/10cm = 0.01-0.1
beta_new = beta/L = etc.
TODO: make L=1 rescaling functional in python and call it at the print statement nested in gen_run_9.py

How must dt be adjusted? 
Let's just stay in units of
