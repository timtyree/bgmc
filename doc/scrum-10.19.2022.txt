DONE: searched for trials with a=1.781,10.147, D=observed from MSR for L=5 in recent runs
DONE: identify trials with a=1.781,10.147, D=observed from MSR for L=10 in run #33

D_fk = 0.1145
amax_fk=1.781 #works
amax_fk=1.9252
#LR
D_lr = 0.4158
amax_lr= 10.147  #works
amax_lr= 11.2437

#TODO(failing ^this): dev run 34 with ^this, rxn>3, and L=5.
#TODO: set rxn<12


DONE: plot annihilation rates fit to FK when rxn=kappa*r^2 = a + 2 D
Q: does ibid look like a reasonable way to estimate the reaction coefficient?

Q: what r values were used?
TODO: dev run 34 with a,D,rxn fixed to observed
TODO: test a fine neighborhood of previous r_best values

DONE: decided ensemble then time averaging is the correct way to estimate amax
TODO(if amax_fk>1.781): remeasure a vs. A with the zero subtracted

TODO: update Letter with linear particle model fits with D fixed to observed.
- ***Option 1: if 1.78,10.147 are used, then a vs. A need not be remeasured
   - PRO: less to do
   - CON: i think i remember fixing D to observed not working.
        ---> looks like it works well enough for general rxn coefficient.
- DONT: Option 2: if 1.93,11.24 are used, then a vs. A must show the same key result that a is insensitive to A.
  - PRO: fixing D to observed works
  - CON: i don't know whether a is insensitive to A when not subtracting MSR(t=0)

Q: which Option to do?
