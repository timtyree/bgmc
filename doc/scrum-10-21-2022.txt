DONE: add the factor increase in predicted taubarp
DONE: add the factor increase in predicted Nbarp
DONE: format as table
DONE: polish tables
DONE: determine the order i reference values in Figure panels
DONE: outline tables to result from breaking up {tab:properties_big}
DONE: update references to tables where needed
DONE: integrate tables 1-3 with text
DONE: put $a=R_{rms}^2 / 4\Gamma$ in text after intro of Linear model
DONT: write out explicitely R_{rms, Osc.}
DONE: update figure 3A
DONE: summarize todo's from physical notebook as %
***from meeting with WJ 10.4.2022:
DONE: instances in the Letter.
DONE: change "equal and opposite"
DONE: introduce osc. particle model after phi(t') and before Eqn. 4
DONE: summarize force discussion
- We have an attractive force
- with an oscillatory component,
- and it has a diffusing component.
DONE: show Eqn. 6 after Eqn. 7
DONE: check figure reference 4E is not actually 2D
DONE: check figure references are correct
DONE: check figure 3A is mentioned in text
DONE: check each figure panel is mentioned in text
GOAL: repurpose narrative around central thesis
- make it clearer
- set up the reader
- take them by the hand
- and tell them at the start
- that $a$ â‰  A in terms of effect on $w_-$
- and that modest increases in $a$ predicts/describes a general cure to atrial fibrillation.
***from scrum 10.5.2022:
DONE: do all of the above.
% DONE(SI; add to methods): use_filterby_minN=True, minN=10

Q: does the LR model really have a 95% CI of 0.6?
- Q: what is the % uncertainty in FK versus LR for ^this measure?
LR: 0.06/0.76 = 7.9% uncert.
FK: 6.5/27.8 = 23% uncert.
not LR: 0.6/0.76 = 79% uncert.
- A: maybe i am. uncert in MTT from FK is ~3X larger than that of LR.

DONE: check where I estimated uncertainty in MTT_LR directly in .ipynb for LR
Q: is the correct uncertainty in \bar\tau(LR) = 0.06 or 0.6 seconds?
A: 0.06 seconds.

$\mathbb{E}[\tau]$ (s)&
25.9 --> 1.7$\times 10^9$

- for increasing area, A, by a factor of 4X,
  the predictions of master equation changes according to:

Linear fit to FK:
L=5  --> L=10
$\mathbb{E}[\tau]$ (s)&
25.9 --> 1.7$\times 10^9$
1.7*10^9/25.9*100
- taubarp_FK: 6.56371*10^9% --> increase in tau by at least factor of ~6.6*10^7

$\mathbb{E}[N]$
8.1 --> 17.1
==> 2.11111
- Nbarp_FK: 2.11111 --> increase in N by 211%

Linear fit to FK:
L=5  --> L=10
$\mathbb{E}[\tau]$ (s)&
0.51 --> 82.13
- taubarp_LR: 161.039 --> increase in tau by 16103.9% ~ 1.6*10^4%

$\mathbb{E}[N]$
4.3 --> 32.3
- Nbarp_LR:  751% --> increase in N by 751%
