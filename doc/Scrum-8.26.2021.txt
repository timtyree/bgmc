notes for run 15
- make L / the number density q the same as in run 13... it looked better there in run 12 or earlier...
- try searching larger D>0.7 cm^2/s... but less than the (min?) D in run 12 or earlier...
- try 0.025cm < r < 0.2cm...
- don't bother with varkappa values greater than 50...
- perhaps for run 16 include force_code=4 and neighbors=1 (a small constant repulsive force between nearest neighbors only...)  include x0_values=[-5,-1,1,5]
