Scrum 1.11.2022:
DONE: implement the oscillatory model with exponential rate of concurrance of phase
DONE: test that ^this gives reasonable estimates of the full models' pair-annihilation rates
DONE: measure the pessimistic expected run time to be <10 hours
DONE: dev Run 22
DONE: launch Run 22
HINT: see dev run .ipynb for notes



run time for 100 trials (for smallest density N=20)
03:29:53
03:30:41

N=1500 pessimistic runtime calculation
07:50:20
08:01:23
11 minutes and 23 seconds
100-20=80 iterations at least as fast as ^that yield
runtime <= 80*(11+23/60) = 15.177777777777777 hours
supposing linear CDF of runtimes yields the expected most-pessimistic runtime to be ~15/2 = 7
thus, expected_runtime <= 7.5 hours < 10 hours
so... if I play within the realm of faster than the pessimistic runtime of the slowest parameter setting, I should be good!

--> use number of iterations my standard 1500, and the job should finish before the 10 hour mark (i.e. by morning!)
