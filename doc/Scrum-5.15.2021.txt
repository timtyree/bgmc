DONE: measure the runtimes of return_CollTimes.x...  Is it fitting in the L1 cache again?

DONE: engineer a run that can use a time resolution of Dt,dt=1e-6 seconds for a trial of niter=1500 

**lowering Dt,dt equally for one trial**
runtime for one trial at 1e-4: ~1  min
runtime for one trial at 1e-5: ~12 min
runtime for one trial at 1e-6: ~2  hrs

**lowering Dt=1e-4, dt=1e-6**
runtime for one trial: ??

############
# Run Design
############
#Suppose 
Dt=1e-5
dt=1e-5
#Then,
n_jobs_per_trial=30
#Then suppose 
niter=50
#^this makes me expect 10 hours per job.

#a 1 cpu test for 8 hours could do niter=40...
