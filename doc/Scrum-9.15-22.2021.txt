__GOAL: move functions to lib and test that they still work__

__GOAL: get final results for PRL paper__
- TODO: put a,D measurements from full models into a table with uncertainty
- TODO: find some plots with low rmse_full and comparable a,D values
- TODO: interpolate from a,D to get some value for r
- TODO: interpolate from a,D to get some value for kappa
- TODO: look at upper and lower bounds for r,kappa using the boundaries of the 95% CI for a,D
- TODO: put these parameter values in a table
- TODO: plot the results for those parameter values

__GOAL: captioned list of figures for PRL paper__
