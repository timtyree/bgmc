TODO: show whether this oscillatory force function can explain the LR model.
TODO: if so, we should should whether the oscillatory force can explain the FK model

Failing ^that:
-  Consider phases that agree powerlaw fast
-  Consider phases that agree but only up to some constant phase, such as Ï€/2.


TODO: does making phi time evolve according to a second-order ODE solve this problem?
TODO: does using second-order classical newtonian mechanics solve this problem?
HINT: can i just solve these analytically instead of computing it directly?
