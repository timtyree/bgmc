<h1>Brownian Gas Monte Carlo (bgmc)</h1>

I'm told that a dozen particles does not constitute a gas...  I beg to differ on a technical level.  If it brings you peace, imagine substituting "g" for "n" for n-bodies in a box.  The manuscript associated with this repository is nearing submission, and will be linked here.

### _What's inside this repository?_
- cached results from large, brute force grid searches of the linear particle model
- command line executables that can be used to generate the aforementioned cached results to machine precision
- a lot of notebooks/*.ipynb documenting the twists and turns of investigating something novel
- a library of python functions used to generate data and figures in the manuscript to machine precision
