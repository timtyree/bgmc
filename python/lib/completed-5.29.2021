DONE: analyze run_11

DONE: implement a 1 parameter, long-ranged attractive force in c/attractive, such as varkappa/r.
Note: for ^that the dimension of varkappa is dX ~ varkappa/(X-mu)(hat{X})dt ~ varkappa / X^2 * X * dt. Thus varkappa ~ T/L^2
DONE: integrate ^that in c/attractive
DONE: dev run_12 in c/attractive


DONE: test return_CollTime.x using a dev/test
