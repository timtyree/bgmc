We consider modeling with the ansatz that the phase goes to zero when two particles meet, that $\\phi\\rightarrow0$ as $R\\rightarrow0$.  To impose this boundary condition on the phases, it is natural to use the backwards-time picture to study the typical time evolution of ^this SDE.  However, since $1/R$ is not well defined at the value $R=0$, we consider initializing our simulation at time $t_f$ and range $R_f$, and then evolving backwards in time with increasing $t'=t_f-t>0$.  \n",
