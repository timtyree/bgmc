TODO: write dask-parser that iterates over all log files where reflect=0 and set_second=0 and merges to a single .csv


TODO(later): write header file that iteratively retries positions for particles s.t. particles always start outside the reaction range, r.  Note this will make Nmax a variable quantity...


DON'T(slow run, fast code... how big is file? 250TB): write c or python-dask functions that (i) bootstraps error bars and (ii) computes mean for fixed input parameters and for fixed N

DONE(fast run, slow code... how big is file? 0.1TB): compute mean T before outputing (
if all trials are not -9999:
	compute mean
	print mean
else:
	print -9999
