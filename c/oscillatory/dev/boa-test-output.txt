/* Testing Effect of Adding a 1cm Basin of Attraction between (i) nearest neighbors and (ii) vector summed forces. */

Key Results made repeatable here:
  1. when using reflective boundary conditions, a small constant repulsive force decreased the annihilation rate independent of whether or not forces were only considered if they were between nearest neighbors.
  2. if periodic boundary conditions were used and the forces were considered as a vector sum between all particles, a small constant repulsive force _increased_ the annihilation rate for 1/r forces but not 1/r^2 forces.

This same result emerged independent of 1/r forces or 1/r^2 forces being used.
