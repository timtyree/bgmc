/* Testing Effect of Attractive/Repulsive Force On Mean Collision Time */

Printing the mean time to first reaction (seconds) before/after turning on a large attractive force...
Tavg=0.00950384
Tavg=0.00754853
If Tavg got smaller, then the rate of collision was increased by a large attractive force.

Testing the effect of turning on large repulsive force...
Tavg=0.00950384
Tavg=0.0225335
If Tavg got larger, then the rate of collision was decreased by a large repulsive force.
Printing the mean time to first reaction (seconds) before/after turning on a small attractive force...
Tavg=0.00950384
Tavg=0.00992838
If Tavg got smaller, then the rate of collision was increased by a small attractive force.

Testing the effect of turning on small repulsive forces...
Tavg=0.00950384
Tavg=0.0101387
If Tavg got larger, then the rate of collision was decreased by a small repulsive force.
