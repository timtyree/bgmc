/* Testing Effect of Attractive/Repulsive Force On Mean Collision Time */\n

Printing the mean time to first reaction (seconds) before/after turning on a large attractive force...
Tavg=0.138964
Tavg=0.128361
If Tavg got smaller, then the rate of collision was increased by a large attractive force.\n

Printing the mean time to first reaction (seconds) before/after turning on a large repulsive force...
Tavg=0.138964
Tavg=0.139525
If Tavg got larger, then the rate of collision was decreased by a large repulsive force.\n

Printing the mean time to first reaction (seconds) before/after turning on a small attractive force...
Tavg=0.138964
Tavg=0.137697
If Tavg got smaller, then the rate of collision was increased by a small attractive force.\n
