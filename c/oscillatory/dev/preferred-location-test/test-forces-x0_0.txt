/* Testing Effect of Attractive/Repulsive Force On Mean Collision Time */

Printing the mean time to first reaction (seconds) before/after turning on a large attractive force...
Tavg=0.128633
Tavg=0.108503
If Tavg got smaller, then the rate of collision was increased by a large attractive force.

Printing the mean time to first reaction (seconds) before/after turning on a large repulsive force...
Tavg=0.128633
Tavg=0.168213
If Tavg got larger, then the rate of collision was decreased by a large repulsive force.

Printing the mean time to first reaction (seconds) before/after turning on a small attractive force...
Tavg=0.128633
Tavg=0.134407
If Tavg got smaller, then the rate of collision was increased by a small attractive force.
