potential differences in WJ's and my code:
- WJ's line #84 iterates over trials strangly:
  - do iter=1,niter
  - ^this means WJ needed to recompute distances, which is fine.

- WJ computes the vector sum for each particle once
  - I previously iterated over all remaining pairs and added forces for either particle.

- WJ uses a different random number generator than me.
  - Q: does gasdev generate normal random variables?
